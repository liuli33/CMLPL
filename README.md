## Preparation
* This pertains to the code implementation of the paper titled "Contrastive Mutual Learning with Pseudo Label Smoothing for Hyperspectral Image Classification".
* Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Download the [Pavia University image](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/uploads/e/ee/PaviaU.mat) and the corresponding [annotations](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/uploads/5/50/PaviaU_gt.mat). Put these files into the `dataset` folder.

## Usage
* Data Preparation:
```
$ python sample_generation.py
``` 

  The default training set is generated by randomly selecting `5` labeled samples from each category.
  
  You can change parameter `--num_label` to check the performance in other training scenarios.
  
* Performance Evaluation:
```
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py
```
